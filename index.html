									<h4><b>Design and Development of Speech Summarisation system for Assamese Broadcast news</b></h4>
									<p align="justify">Transcribing spoken documents like - speech, presentations, lectures, and news broadcasts is one of
the most important uses of automatic speech recognition. Although speech is the most natural and
successful form of human communication, it is difficult to rapidly evaluate, retrieve, and reuse speech
documents that are merely captured as audio signals. Therefore, text summarization systems use ASR
systems to first transcribe the speech and then apply algorithms to remove unnecessary information
and extract the most important out of it before storing it. But due to transcription of speech, it loses
important prosodic and acoustic features. Use of speech summarization solves this problem by
preserving the important prosodic and acoustic features and improves the sound retrieval process.
Speech summarization is the process of gathering information from a speech and creating a condensed
version that includes all the important points.</br>
This project focuses on the development of a speech summarization system and evaluation of the
summary generated by machine with a human generated summary</br>
The projects includes : Corpus Building using Assamese Broadcast News, Feature Extraction , Labelling using both native and non native speakers and classification using ML algorithms.</br>
Tools used are : Praat,Audacity,Python.

										<p><b>An acoustic/prosodic feature-based audio dataset for Assamese speech summarization</b></br>
										Publisher: Springer ,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems ( ISSN: 2367-3370).</p>
										<p align="justify">In this paper, we focus on creating a dataset for speech summarization
in Assamese which is a low-resource language, where the genre of speech
is Broadcast News. The contribution of this paper is two folds: Firstly
a dataset of the audio samples of the broadcast news comprised of the
acoustic/prosodic features is developed, where each tuple is the manually
segmented utterance representing a sentence. Each utterance is labelled
as either summary-worthy or not summary-worthy, in accordance to the
handcrafted summaries. Secondly, the relation of the prosodic features
in indicating the informativeness of an utterance is evaluated. Binary
classification is also performed with the help of various classifiers, and
a statistical analysis of the performance of the classifiers is presented.

This approach for speech summarization is highly relevant for resource-
poor language which do not have speech-to-text tools to generate the

textual representation of the audio. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first effort to develop a dataset in Assamese language for speech
summarization. </p>
